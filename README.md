# Chest X-ray Classification for COVID-19, Normal, and Pneumonia using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)
- This repository contains code for a deep learning project that classifies chest X-ray images into three classes: COVID-19, Normal, and Pneumonia. The classification is performed using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). Additionally, a Streamlit web application has been developed for easy visualization and testing of the trained model.

## Dataset
- The dataset used for training and testing the model consists of chest X-ray images labeled as COVID-19, Normal, or Pneumonia. The dataset is divided into train and test sets to evaluate model performance.

## Model Architecture
- The CNN model architecture used for classification consists of multiple convolutional layers followed by max-pooling layers and fully connected layers. The model is trained using the train set and evaluated using the test set to assess its performance.

## Streamlit Web Application
- A Streamlit web application has been developed to provide an interactive interface for users to upload chest X-ray images and get predictions from the trained model. The application allows users to visualize the uploaded image and view the predicted class probabilities.
